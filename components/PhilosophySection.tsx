          <p className="step-body">
            We isolate the tonal soul from the percussive drive. Every song
            enters the pipeline as a single waveform and emerges as two: harmony
            and rhythm, each analyzed independently, then reunited in the final
            rendering.

            Every pitch class maps to a specific color coordinate on the Circle
            of Fifths. C is warm coral. G is amber. D is gold-green. These
            assignments are not aesthetic choices &mdash; they are fixed points
            in a perceptually uniform color space, derived from the OKLCH model.

            Each ring is a detected moment. The sonicture grows outward from the
            center like tree rings, with each concentric band representing a beat
            or onset in the audio. Ring thickness encodes loudness. Ring color
            encodes pitch.

          <p className="step-body">
            Harmony has weight. The rings drift toward the dominant key,
            pulled by a gravitational center computed from the chroma
            distribution. Songs that stay close to home produce tight,
            centered forms. Songs that wander produce asymmetric,
            exploratory shapes.

            A white filament traces the human voice through the instrumental
            architecture. Where the singer enters, the silk thread appears.
            Where they rest, it vanishes. Vocal pitch bends the thread
            vertically &mdash; high notes rise, low notes fall &mdash; mapping
            the melody onto the geometry of the sonicture.
